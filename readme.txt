Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 characters.  No markup here.

Nothing Special, just a widget that contains subHeader, Header (title) and Text with manyu useful styleing controls which I think elementor needed to have.
- Elementor Widget that has a subtitle, title and text/description with many styles and controllers.
- adds a "Edit Post" to elementors posts and loop items in front area if logged in as admin.
- Glass Blur Effect

Depricated:
- Admin CSS styleing.
- Admin Area Page.

TODO: add img and icon, and more controls for widget.
